## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document (or notebook). Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Meet the pipe operator %>%

The pipe operator ` %>% ` allows you to link together multiple dplyr operations.
You can type the pipe %>%  using the following shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + m` [Windows] or `Cmd + Shift + m` [Mac OS].

Using the pipe operator you will not have to assign the outcome of each step to a new object.

Consider the following scenario where we want to: 

1. keep only certain variables, **then** 
2. filter to keep only certain cars, **then**
3. take the log of `hwy`

The standard code (without pipe) would be:

```{r}
mpg_rec1 <- select(mpg, displ, hwy, year)
mpg_rec2 <- filter(mpg_rec1, year == 1999)
mpg_rec3 <- mutate(mpg_rec2, hwy_log = log(hwy))
```

This way, we are creating a data object at every step, making the code hard to read. 

The pipe allows us to avoid this. In order to use the pipe, we need to **start with the data** and then add a pipe at each subsequent operation. 

A good tip is to mentally read each pipe operator as "then". E.g. first I select, %>% (read: **"then"**) I filer, %>% (read: **"then"**) I mutate...

Note that when you use the pipe, you can avid  setting the data argument for each function, as this is taken from the pipe automatically!

```{r}
mpg_rec <- mpg %>% 
  select(displ, hwy, year) %>%     # note: the data argument is no longer set!
  filter(year == 1999) %>% 
  mutate(hwy_log = log(hwy))

mpg_rec
```

Finally, note that you can insert plots directly in the pipe, but you will have to switch the pipe to a ggplot2's `+`:

```{r}
mpg_rec <- mpg %>% 
  select(displ, hwy, year) %>%     # note: the data is no longer set!
  filter(year == 1999) %>% 
  mutate(hwy_log = log(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +     # <-- note  the `+`
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy_log))
```
